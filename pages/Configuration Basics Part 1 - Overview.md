This page provides an overview of the available configuration files and
 directories. It explains what is configured in which file.

* `config.yml`:
  
  Global config options like the timezone to use for the time placeholder. 
  You most likely don't need to edit anything in here.

* `tabLists/`
  
  Here are the files for configuring the actual look of the tab list. By default
  there is only one file called `default.yml`. You can however create more files
  to provide different tab lists to players depending on several conditions 
  (e.g. the players server or permission group). Details of how to do this will
  be discussed later.

* `heads/`
  
  This is the location of image files which can be used as icons in the tab list.
  You can add custom icons if you like. The files must be in the png format and
  have a size of 8x8 pixel.
