There is a folder called `tabLists` and in this folder is one file called default.yml which contains the tablist layout. Seeing this you might wonder why there's a folder if there's only one file in it. This is because you can have multiple tab lists. A second tablist is created by making a copy of default.yml and giving it another name (which has to end with `.yml`). After creating a new file you should edit it. Especially important is to change `showTo` which defines who will see a specific tablist and `priority` which is used to determine which tab list a player will see if multiple tab lists match.
