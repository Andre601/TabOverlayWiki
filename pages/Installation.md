Installing BungeeTabListPlus
============================

System Requirements
-------------------

* BungeeCord build 995 or newer
* You can use the plugin with older Minecraft clients by using the ProtocolSupportBungee plugin
* Java 8
* Memory requirements: _The memory required by your BungeeCord setup may differ from the values given below, depending on your configuration and other plugins you use._

    Players | Minimum RAM required
    ------- | --------------------
    25      | 100MB
    50      | 250MB
    100     | 500MB
    250     | 1GB

Installation
------------

1. Download BungeeTabListPlus.jar from the spigotmc website or from jenkins and install it on your BungeeCord server.

   If you have multiple BungeeCord servers connected using RedisBungee install the plugin on all BungeeCord servers.

2. **Optional:** Download BungeeTabListPlus_BukkitBridge.jar from the spigotmc website or from jenkins and install it on all your Spigot and Bukkit servers.

   This step is required for most variables to work. Also things like VanishNoPacket support won't work without this.
