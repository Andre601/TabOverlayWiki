### System Requirements

* BungeeCord build 995 or newer
* Minecraft 1.8 or newer works out of the box.

  To use older Minecraft versions you can use one of the following solutions:
  - Travertine or a similar BungeeCord fork.
  - ViaVersion with ViaBackwards and ViaRewind (on BungeeCord).
  - ProtocolSupportBungee.

* Java 8

### Installation

1. Download BungeeTabListPlus.jar from the spigotmc website or from jenkins and install it on your BungeeCord server.

   If you have multiple BungeeCord servers connected using RedisBungee install the plugin on all BungeeCord servers.

2. **Optional:** Download BungeeTabListPlus_BukkitBridge.jar from the spigotmc website or from jenkins and install it on all your Spigot and Bukkit servers.

   This step is required for most variables to work. Also things like VanishNoPacket support will not work without this.
