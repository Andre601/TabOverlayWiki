### 24Bit RGB Colors

**Note:** This feature is only available on 1.16 or later. If there are older clients connected to the server this won't work.

You can use `&#RRGGBB`, `{#RRGGBB}` or `[color=#RRGGBB]` to use any color in hexadecimal notation.
You have to replace `#RRGGBB` with a color in hexadecimal notation, e.g. `#012345`.

If you have a resource pack on your server providing additional fonts, you can use those as well.
